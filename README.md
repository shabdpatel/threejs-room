## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to create a 3D scene of a room with randomly placed interior objects using Three.js. The room is modeled within a 1000 sqft area, and various objects are placed randomly to simulate a realistic interior environment.

## Features

- 3D room modeled with Three.js
- Randomly placed interior objects
- Interactive camera controls
- Realistic lighting and shadows

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: A JavaScript 3D library that makes WebGL simpler
- **JavaScript**: The programming language used for the logic
- **HTML5**: Markup language for the web page structure
- **CSS3**: Style sheet language for styling the web page
